# Tennis Club Project

## Description
The UMass Tennis Club Project is a comprehensive web application designed for the University of Massachusetts Tennis Club. The primary goal is to enhance the club's organization beyond the existing Discord server. The application aims to provide an aesthetically pleasing and scalable platform for UMass Tennis Club members to access information, register for events, and connect with fellow players.

## Tech Stack
The website utilizes Svelte for dynamic UI and Express.js for microservices API, featuring three microservices: user-service, tournament-service, and notification-service. An event-bus facilitates communication among these microservices. The tech stack includes Docker, Docker Compose, and PM2 for containerization, deployment, and scalability testing. I used Supabase for simple database management. 

## Page Description
The Home page provides general club information, while the Membership page details membership benefits and payment information. The League page allows users to sign up for tournaments based on their ranking, with email notifications upon successful registration. The Players page lists all registered players, allowing users to view details and contact others for casual matches. The Profile page enables users to edit their information, with email notifications for updates. The Login page facilitates user authentication, albeit without passwords for the project's scope.
